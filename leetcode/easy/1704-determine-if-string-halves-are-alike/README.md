# Determine if String Halves Are Alike

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a string `s` of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths, and let `a` be the first half and `b` be the second half.

Two strings are  **alike**  if they have the same number of vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`, `'A'`, `'E'`, `'I'`, `'O'`, `'U'`). Notice that `s` contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return `true` *if* `a` *and* `b` *are  **alike***. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "book"
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 vowel and b has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "textbook"
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 1 vowel whereas b has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.
Notice that the vowel o is counted twice.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= s.length <= 1000
- s.length is even.
- s consists of uppercase and lowercase letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean halvesAreAlike(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int vowelsCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if (isVowel(s.charAt(i))) {
                vowelsCount++;
            }
            if (isVowel(s.charAt(i + n / 2))) {
                vowelsCount--;
            }
        }

        return vowelsCount == 0;
    }

    private boolean isVowel(char c) {
        return "aeiouAEIOU".indexOf(c) != -1;
    }
}
```
